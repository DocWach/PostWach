## Scoring Dimensions

- **Research Value (RV):** Novelty, impact, contribution to field (5=paradigm shift, 1=minor variation)
- **Feasibility (F):** Methodology readiness, data access, expertise available (5=proven, 1=fundamental obstacles)
- **Strategic Alignment (SA):** NSF proposal fit, dependency satisfaction, year mapping (5=active proposal year, 1=no strategic link)
- **Resource Cost (RC):** Effort, co-author needs, equipment/IRB — inverted (5=solo/<3mo, 1=large team/multi-year)
- **Dependency Readiness (DR):** Are prerequisite ideas complete? (5=all done, 1=critical dependency blocked)

**Composite:** EPV = 0.25\*RV + 0.20\*F + 0.25\*SA + 0.10\*RC + 0.20\*DR

## Scoring Rationale

### Top Tier (EPV >= 4.0)

**Idea 5 — Isomorphism Catalog (4.70):** Highest-scoring idea, correctly in progress. Foundation of the entire portfolio — unblocks Ideas 6, 20-25, and ultimately 19. No dependencies. Proven methodology. Maximum strategic alignment as the anchor of the NSF first proposal.

**Idea 3 — Bayesian Confidence (4.30):** Draft already exists, giving it F=4 despite formally depending on Ideas 5 and 6. Fills the National Academies VVUQ gap. In the NSF first proposal cluster. DR=3 because the draft pre-dates the dependency chain, providing a workaround.

**Idea 6 — Morphism Metric (4.30):** Ties with Idea 3. The 5-layer metric (structural, behavioral, energy, information, categorical) is novel and highly citable. On the critical path (5→6→3). SA=5 as the bridge between the catalog and everything downstream. DR=4 because Idea 5 is in progress and on track. F=3 because the 5-layer framework needs substantial development.

### Upper Middle (3.65–3.95)

**Idea 1 — SysML v2 Analysis (3.95):** Timely (SysML v2 just approved). Methodology is a structured comparison extending the dissertation's Table 4. Fully independent — no dependencies. SA=3 because it's not in the NSF first proposal, but could be a quick, publishable win.

**Idea 11 — DEVS/T3SD Boundaries (3.95):** Dissertation section 101 already contains key findings. High feasibility due to existing material. Independent. Could be developed as a companion piece to Idea 5.

**Idea 2 — VM & Digital Twins (3.75):** Digital twins are a hot topic. F=3 because the January 2026 discussion identified unresolved conceptual questions (what does a DT represent vs. what does a VM represent). Those questions need resolution before writing.

**Idea 7 — Verification Requirement Types (3.70):** Clean, focused scope. Connects directly to dissertation VMMC types. Independent. Lower RV=3 because the contribution is narrower.

**Idea 23 — Mental Model Fidelity (3.70):** The most conceptually exciting of the Year 3 ideas — turns the VMMC framework reflexively onto the engineer's own mental model. RV=5 for novelty. But DR=2 (depends on 5 and 6) and RC=2 (IRB, participants, cognitive science methodology) hold it back for now.

### Middle Tier (3.20–3.65)

**Ideas 8, 13 (3.65 each):** Biomimetics extends the catalog to novel domain pairs; Morphisms-vs-TL appeals to AI audiences. Both are Phase 2-3 capabilities.

**Idea 16 — Category Theory SE (3.60):** Highest RV in the portfolio (tied at 5) but F=2 — enormous scope requiring deep category theory. This is a multi-year, potentially career-defining paper. Not for now.

**Ideas 17, 20, 21 (3.45 each):** Ideas 20-21 have SA=5 (NSF Year 3) but are held back by DR=2 and RC=2. They'll rise in EPV once Ideas 5 and 6 complete.

### Lower Tier (< 3.20)

**Idea 19 — Min Math Toolkit (2.80):** Lowest EPV despite RV=5. This is the capstone synthesis — it literally cannot proceed until Ideas 5-18 are substantially complete (DR=1). Correctly ranked last.

**Idea 15 — Homomorphic Encryption (3.05):** Short communication. Lowest research value but highest resource efficiency (RC=5). A quick publication if a gap in the writing schedule opens.

## EVOI Analysis — Top 3 Candidates for "Next After Idea 5"

### Candidate 1: Idea 6 (Morphism Metric) — EPV 4.30

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Key uncertainty | Can the 5-layer metric be operationalized? Does approximate bisimulation (Girard & Pappas) map cleanly to the VMMC types? |
| Investigation action | 4-hour literature deep-dive on approximate bisimulation metrics; sketch layer definitions against 2-3 catalog entries from Idea 5 |
| Estimated EVOI | Medium — the conceptual direction is clear but calibration against VMMC is uncertain |
| Investigation cost | ~1 day |
| **Decision** | **Investigate briefly, then commit** |

### Candidate 2: Idea 3 (Bayesian Confidence) — EPV 4.30

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Key uncertainty | How much revision does the existing draft need? Does it hold up against current Ideas 5/6 framing? |
| Investigation action | Re-read existing draft (2-3 hours); assess alignment with current morphism framework |
| Estimated EVOI | Low — draft exists, risk is low |
| Investigation cost | ~3 hours |
| **Decision** | **Commit now (draft de-risks it)** |

### Candidate 3: Idea 1 (SysML v2 Analysis) — EPV 3.95

| Factor | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Key uncertainty | Is the SysML v2 spec stable enough to publish against? Will OMG revise the beta before final? |
| Investigation action | Check OMG SysML v2 finalization timeline |
| Estimated EVOI | Low — the comparison methodology is straightforward regardless of minor spec changes |
| Investigation cost | ~1 hour |
| **Decision** | **Commit if a parallel slot opens** |

## Recommendation

**Continue Idea 5 as current paper.** Highest EPV (4.70), in progress, no action needed.

**Primary next paper: Idea 6 (Morphism Metric).**
- EPV 4.30 (tied rank 2 of 25)
- Critical path position: 5 → 6 → 3; completing Idea 6 unblocks the most downstream value (Ideas 3, 20-25, and ultimately 19)
- Completing Idea 6 raises DR scores for 8 ideas (20-25 go from DR=2 to DR=3-4; Idea 3 goes from DR=3 to DR=5)
- The 5-layer metric is the quantitative backbone of the NSF proposal

**Parallel opportunity: Revisit Idea 3 draft alongside Idea 6.**
- The draft exists from prior work and is partially independent
- Light revision pass while Idea 6 is primary would validate alignment
- If the draft holds up, Ideas 3 and 6 could be submitted close together

**Why not Idea 3 as primary:** Completing Idea 3 before Idea 6 creates a narrative gap — the confidence framework would reference a metric that doesn't exist yet. Idea 6 first gives Idea 3 a stronger foundation to cite.

**Independent quick wins (if parallel capacity):**
- Idea 1 (SysML v2, EPV 3.95): No dependencies, timely, contained scope
- Idea 11 (DEVS/T3SD, EPV 3.95): Builds on existing dissertation content

**Dependency impact of completing Idea 6:**
- Directly unblocks: Ideas 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (all Year 3 cognitive studies)
- Strengthens: Idea 3 (DR rises from 3 to 5)
- Advances NSF first proposal: 2 of 6 cluster ideas would be complete (5 and 6)

## Key Insights

1. **Current allocation is correct.** Idea 5 has the highest EPV (4.70) and is in progress — no rebalancing needed now.

2. **Idea 6 should be primary next, not Idea 3.** Despite the existing draft for Idea 3, the critical path (5→6→3) and the downstream unblocking value of Idea 6 make it the higher-leverage choice. Idea 3's draft can be revisited in parallel.

3. **Year 3 ideas (20-25) are correctly deferred.** Their DR scores (all =2) accurately reflect that Ideas 5 and 6 must advance first. They'll naturally rise in EPV as foundations complete.

4. **Two independent quick wins exist.** Ideas 1 (SysML v2) and 11 (DEVS/T3SD) both score 3.95 with DR=5 and could be developed in parallel with the main critical path if capacity allows.

5. **Idea 19 (Capstone) should remain last.** DR=1 is the binding constraint and won't change for years.
