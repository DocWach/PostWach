**Created:** January 27, 2026
**Status:** Active
**Purpose:** Track topics requiring refinement, clarification, or expansion

## Priority Topics

### 1. Formal Methods Mapping Refinement ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue:** The formal methods integration in `postwach_complete_v2.html` contains inaccuracies that need correction through collaborative discussion.

**Specific Problem:**
- T3SD is incorrectly described as "Three-Space Decomposition"
- The actual meaning and application of T3SD needs to be clarified
- Formal methods mappings need to be validated against Dr. Wach's actual research

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Clarify what T3SD actually stands for and represents
- [ ] Review DEVS formalism descriptions for accuracy
- [ ] Validate category theory application descriptions
- [ ] Correct HTML documentation with accurate formal methods mapping
- [ ] Update agent descriptions that reference formal methods

**Files Affected:**
- `docs/postwach_complete_v2.html`
- `docs/MSC_Coverage_Analysis.md`
- `.claude-flow/research-agents/proof-constructor.json`
- `.claude-flow/workflows/templates/formal-verification.json`
