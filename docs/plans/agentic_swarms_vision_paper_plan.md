## 1. Vision Paper Characteristics

Unlike position papers (which argue a stance) or survey papers (which comprehensively review), vision papers:
- Paint a compelling picture of a future state
- Articulate transformative potential
- Identify enabling technologies and milestones
- Connect to broader trends and trajectories
- Inspire action and research directions

---

## 2. Paper Objectives

1. Articulate a compelling vision of SE practice augmented by AI swarms (5-10 year horizon)
2. Describe the transformation from current practice to envisioned future
3. Identify key enablers and milestones on the path
4. Connect to INCOSE Vision 2035 and digital engineering transformation
5. Inspire research and development investment
