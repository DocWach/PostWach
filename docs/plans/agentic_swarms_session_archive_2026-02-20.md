## Project Status (as of this session)

| Paper | Version | Words | Status |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|

## What Needs to Happen Next (when resumed)

1. User may want PDF/DOCX conversion of the white paper for distribution
2. Decide which academic paper to submit first (survey vs. combined vs. vision)
3. Revision pass on chosen paper — tighten prose, verify citations, check cross-references
4. Reference validation — confirm all 150+ citations are real and correctly cited
5. Finalize figures for publication quality
6. Apply target venue template (IEEE, Wiley/INCOSE)
