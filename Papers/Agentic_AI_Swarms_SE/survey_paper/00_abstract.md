## Abstract

The convergence of multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, and large language model-based agentic AI creates new possibilities for augmenting systems engineering practice. This survey systematically organizes this emerging field, synthesizing 150+ publications across artificial intelligence, software engineering, systems engineering, and human factors communities.

We present taxonomies of agent architectures—from classical reactive and BDI designs through contemporary LLM-based agents with tool use and memory—and coordination mechanisms spanning communication-based, organization-based, and emergent approaches. We map applications to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 technical processes, surveying over 30 frameworks and mapping applications across 14 ISO 15288 process areas, revealing concentrated maturity in requirements analysis and test generation with substantial gaps across the remaining lifecycle.

Our evaluation analysis identifies critical gaps: no standardized benchmarks exist for multi-agent SE systems, and tools and frameworks, while maturing rapidly, lack SE-specific integration. We categorize challenges as technical (scalability, reliability, domain knowledge), integration (tool, process, data), human factors (trust, oversight, skills), and organizational (governance, certification, accountability).

Based on this analysis, we propose a prioritized research agenda: near-term benchmark development, reliability characterization, and domain knowledge grounding; medium-term coordination at scale, human-AI teaming, and governance frameworks; long-term collective engineering intelligence and appropriate automation boundaries. For researchers, this survey provides organized access to fragmented literature and identifies high-priority gaps. For practitioners, it offers realistic capability assessment. For the broader community, it establishes common vocabulary enabling cumulative progress toward AI-augmented systems engineering.

*Index Terms*— multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, large language models, agentic AI, systems engineering, ISO 15288, human-AI collaboration
