## Abstract

The convergence of multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, and large language model-based agentic AI creates new possibilities for augmenting systems engineering practice. This survey provides systematic organization of this emerging field, synthesizing contributions across artificial intelligence, software engineering, systems engineering, and human factors research communities.

We present taxonomies of agent architectures—from classical reactive and BDI designs through contemporary LLM-based agents with tool use and memory capabilities—and coordination mechanisms spanning communication-based, organization-based, and emergent approaches. We map applications to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 technical processes, revealing concentrated maturity in requirements analysis and test generation with substantial gaps in other lifecycle phases.

Our analysis of evaluation methods identifies critical gaps: no standardized benchmarks exist for multi-agent systems in SE contexts, limiting rigorous cross-study comparison. We survey tools and frameworks, noting rapid maturation of LLM-based agent platforms while observing limited SE-specific integration.

We categorize challenges as technical (scalability, reliability, domain knowledge), integration (tool, process, data), human factors (trust, oversight, skills), and organizational (governance, certification, accountability). Based on challenge analysis, we propose a prioritized research agenda: near-term focus on benchmark development, reliability characterization, and domain knowledge grounding; medium-term attention to coordination at scale, human-AI teaming, and governance frameworks; long-term investigation of collective engineering intelligence and appropriate automation boundaries.

This survey provides researchers organized access to fragmented literature and identifies high-priority gaps. For practitioners, it offers realistic assessment of current capabilities. For the broader community, it establishes common vocabulary and frameworks enabling cumulative progress toward AI-augmented systems engineering.
