## 10. Conclusion

This survey has provided a systematic examination of multi-agent AI systems for systems engineering, synthesizing contributions from artificial intelligence, software engineering, systems engineering, and human factors research communities.

### Summary of Findings

This survey synthesized literature spanning 150+ publications across AI, software engineering, systems engineering, and human factors communities. We identified four major agent architecture families, six coordination mechanism categories, and mapped applications across 14 ISO 15288 technical process areas. Our analysis revealed concentrated maturity in two process areas (requirements analysis and test generation) with substantial gaps across the remaining lifecycle.

We traced the foundations of this emerging field through multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, and LLM-based agentic AI, establishing the rationale for multi-agent approaches to systems engineering support. Our taxonomy of agent architectures identified the shift from classical BDI and reactive designs toward LLM-based agents with tool use and memory capabilities. Analysis of coordination mechanisms revealed trade-offs between predictability and flexibility, scalability and control, that must be navigated for SE applications.

Evaluation methods and benchmarks remain underdeveloped, limiting rigorous progress assessment. Tools and frameworks are maturing rapidly, though SE-specific integration remains limited. We identified critical challenges in reliability, domain knowledge integration, trust calibration, and governance—challenges that must be addressed for responsible adoption.

### Key Takeaways

For researchers, this survey provides organized access to a fragmented literature and identifies high-priority gaps warranting investigation. For practitioners, it offers a map of current capabilities and realistic assessment of maturity levels. For the broader community, it establishes common vocabulary and frameworks enabling cumulative progress.

### Looking Forward

The field stands at an inflection point. Foundational capabilities exist; challenges are identified; directions are clear. The research agenda we propose—from near-term benchmark development and reliability characterization through medium-term human-AI teaming and governance frameworks to long-term collective engineering intelligence—provides a structured path forward. Progress requires sustained research investment, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and engagement between researchers and practitioners. The potential prize—substantially augmented engineering capability for addressing society's complex challenges—justifies the effort required.

We invite the community to build upon this survey, address the gaps identified, and realize the potential of multi-agent AI for systems engineering.
