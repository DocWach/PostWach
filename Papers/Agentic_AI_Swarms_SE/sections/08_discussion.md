## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 Implications for Systems Engineering Practice

The framework presented in this paper suggests several implications for SE practice:

**Augmentation, not replacement.** Agentic AI swarms are positioned to augment human systems engineers, not replace them. The framework identifies tasks where AI swarms add value (parallel analysis, comprehensive coverage, artifact generation) while recognizing activities requiring human judgment (stakeholder engagement, creative insight, accountability for decisions). Organizations should approach AI swarms as force multipliers enabling their engineers to address greater complexity rather than as substitutes for engineering expertise.

**Process adaptation.** Effective use of AI swarms may require adaptations to traditional SE processes. Sequential review gates designed for human work products may not match the rapid, iterative nature of AI-generated artifacts. Organizations may need to develop new review approaches, quality criteria, and approval workflows suited to human-AI collaborative outputs.

**Skill evolution.** Systems engineers working with AI swarms will need new skills: formulating effective prompts, evaluating AI outputs, managing swarm configurations, and intervening appropriately when swarm behavior deviates from expectations. Engineering education and professional development must evolve to prepare practitioners for this collaborative paradigm.

### 8.2 Implications for Systems Engineering Research

This work opens several research avenues:

**Empirical validation.** The framework presented here is conceptual; empirical studies are needed to validate effectiveness claims and identify boundary conditions. Controlled experiments comparing swarm-assisted vs. traditional SE approaches, field studies in operational engineering environments, and longitudinal tracking of project outcomes would strengthen the evidence base.

**Formalization.** More rigorous formal treatment of swarm architectures—using established formalisms from multi-agent systems, coordination theory, and systems engineering ontologies—would enable more precise reasoning about swarm properties and behaviors.

**Tool development.** Practical adoption requires tools supporting swarm configuration, execution, monitoring, and analysis. Research into tool architectures, user interfaces, and integration with existing SE tool chains (MBSE tools, requirements management systems, configuration management) would accelerate adoption.

### 8.3 Relationship to Digital Engineering and MBSE

The emergence of agentic AI swarms coincides with the digital engineering transformation in systems engineering. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) establishes authoritative system models as the primary means of communication among engineering disciplines [58, 59]. AI swarms could serve as participants in this model-centric ecosystem:

- Swarms could consume system models, analyze properties, and generate derived artifacts
- Shared system models could serve as the coordination mechanism for swarm state
- Model-based traceability could support governance and audit requirements for AI contributions

This synergy suggests that organizations advancing MBSE maturity may be best positioned to adopt AI swarm capabilities, and vice versa.

### 8.4 Limitations

This work has several limitations:

1. **Conceptual framework.** The mapping is conceptual rather than empirically validated; actual effectiveness in practice remains to be demonstrated.
2. **Technology maturity.** Agentic AI swarms are early-stage technology; capabilities and limitations are evolving rapidly.
3. **Domain generalization.** While intended as domain-agnostic, the examples and analysis reflect the authors' experience primarily in aerospace and defense; applicability to other domains requires validation.
4. **Single perspective.** This paper presents one architectural approach; alternative frameworks may prove more effective for specific contexts.

These limitations should be addressed through empirical research and practical application as the technology matures.
