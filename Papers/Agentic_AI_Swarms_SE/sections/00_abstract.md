## Abstract

Modern engineered systems—spanning aerospace, defense, healthcare, and energy domains—exhibit complexity that strains the capacity of systems engineering organizations. While artificial intelligence offers promise for augmenting engineering practice, single-agent AI systems face fundamental limitations when applied to systems engineering's inherently collaborative, multi-disciplinary nature.

This paper presents a framework for applying agentic AI swarms to systems engineering—coordinated multi-agent systems in which specialized AI agents collaborate to support lifecycle activities. We trace the evolution of AI capabilities through six tiers, from expert systems through machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to agentic AI and agentic swarms, contextualizing each tier's relevance to systems engineering practice.

Our architectural framework comprises specialized agent roles aligned with systems engineering disciplines, coordination topologies (hierarchical, mesh, hybrid), and coordination mechanisms (shared memory, messaging, consensus, orchestration). The core contribution maps swarm capabilities to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 technical process areas, demonstrating applicability across stakeholder needs definition, requirements engineering, architecture definition, design, integration, verification, validation, and lifecycle support.

Domain examples in aerospace (satellite development), defense (weapon system acquisition), healthcare (medical device development), and energy (power grid modernization) validate the framework's domain-agnostic generality. We identify key challenges—coordination overhead, domain knowledge integration, emergent behavior management, evaluation metrics, human-swarm interaction, and governance—and propose research directions for each.

For systems engineering practitioners and researchers, this paper provides a foundation for understanding how AI swarms may augment engineering capability while preserving essential human judgment and accountability.
