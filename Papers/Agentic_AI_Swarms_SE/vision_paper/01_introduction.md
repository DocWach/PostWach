## 1. Introduction: The Capacity Challenge

### 1.1 The Growing Gap

Systems engineering organizations face a widening gap between the complexity of systems they must develop and their capacity to develop them. Modern engineered systems—satellites, aircraft, medical devices, power grids—integrate more functionality, span more disciplines, and involve more stakeholders than their predecessors. Requirements number in the thousands or tens of thousands. Interfaces proliferate as systems connect to larger ecosystems. Regulatory and safety constraints grow more demanding.

Yet the capacity of engineering organizations has not grown proportionally. Engineering talent remains scarce. Budgets and schedules remain constrained. The result is a capacity deficit: organizations struggling to apply sufficient engineering rigor to increasingly complex challenges.

### 1.2 Digital Engineering as Partial Solution

The systems engineering community has responded with digital transformation. Model-based systems engineering replaces documents with formal models. Digital threads maintain continuity from requirements through operations. Automated analysis enables broader design exploration. These advances help—but they do not close the capacity gap. Digital tools amplify human capability; they do not substitute for it. The fundamental constraint remains human engineering capacity.

### 1.3 The Promise of AI Augmentation

Artificial intelligence offers a different kind of amplification. Recent advances—particularly in large language models and agentic AI systems—demonstrate capabilities directly relevant to systems engineering: natural language understanding, code generation, analytical reasoning, tool use. Individual AI assistants already help engineers draft documents, analyze requirements, and explore designs.

But the full potential lies not in individual AI assistants but in coordinated multi-agent systems—agentic AI swarms—that can collaborate on complex engineering challenges. Just as human engineering organizations achieve what individual engineers cannot, AI swarms can achieve what individual AI agents cannot. The combination of human engineering teams and AI swarms promises a transformation in engineering capacity.

### 1.4 Purpose of This Paper

This paper articulates a vision for systems engineering practice augmented by agentic AI swarms. We describe what this future could look like, chart the transformation path from present to future, identify enabling technologies and organizational capabilities required, and connect this vision to broader industry trajectories.

Our purpose is not prediction but aspiration—articulating a compelling future state that can guide investment, research, and organizational preparation. The future is not predetermined; it will be shaped by the choices the systems engineering community makes. This vision offers one direction worth pursuing.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the envisioned future state. Section 3 charts the transformation path. Section 4 identifies enabling technologies and capabilities. Section 5 connects to industry trajectories. Section 6 issues calls to action. Section 7 concludes.
