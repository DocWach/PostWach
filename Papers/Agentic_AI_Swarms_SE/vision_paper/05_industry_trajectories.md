## 5. Connection to Industry Trajectories

The vision articulated in this paper does not exist in isolation. It connects to and builds upon broader transformations already underway in systems engineering practice. This section positions AI-swarm-augmented systems engineering within these ongoing industry trajectories.

### 5.1 INCOSE Vision 2035

The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) has articulated a vision for the future of systems engineering that emphasizes transformation toward more capable, efficient, and impactful practice [56]. Key themes of INCOSE Vision 2035 include:

- *Addressing global challenges* through engineered systems that are more sustainable, resilient, and responsive to societal needs
- *Accelerating the pace of systems realization* while maintaining quality and managing complexity
- *Leveraging digital and model-based approaches* to enable more effective engineering
- *Developing the systems engineering workforce* with new skills and capabilities

AI swarm augmentation aligns directly with these themes. Swarm-augmented engineering teams can address greater complexity, accelerate development timelines, leverage digital representations fully, and enable engineers to focus on higher-value activities. The vision presented here offers a path toward INCOSE's aspirations—AI swarms as an enabling capability for the transformed practice INCOSE envisions.

### 5.2 Digital Engineering Transformation

Major systems engineering organizations are pursuing digital engineering transformations that create the foundation for AI swarm augmentation:

**Department of Defense Digital Engineering Strategy** calls for transitioning from document-based to model-based engineering, establishing authoritative sources of truth, and enabling data-driven decision-making across the acquisition lifecycle. The digital thread concept—continuous, traceable information from requirements through sustainment—provides the substrate AI swarms require.

**NASA Model-Based Systems Engineering Pathfinder** advances model-based approaches across NASA missions, developing practices, tools, and workforce capabilities for model-centric engineering. NASA's emphasis on formal verification and validation creates natural opportunities for AI swarm contribution.

**Industry digital transformation initiatives** at aerospace, defense, and commercial organizations pursue similar goals: integrated digital representations, automated analysis and verification, continuous lifecycle support. These initiatives create the infrastructure and organizational readiness that AI swarm adoption requires.

AI swarms can serve as accelerators for digital engineering transformation. Organizations that have established digital foundations are positioned to adopt AI augmentation; AI augmentation, in turn, amplifies the value of digital investments. The synergy suggests prioritizing digital engineering maturity as preparation for AI-augmented practice.

### 5.3 Industry 4.0 and Digital Twins

The convergence of AI, simulation, and engineering practice extends beyond systems engineering into broader Industry 4.0 concepts:

**Digital twins**—virtual representations maintained in correspondence with physical systems—offer opportunities for AI swarm contribution throughout the system lifecycle. AI swarms can maintain and analyze digital twins, using operational data to improve predictions, identify anomalies, and optimize performance.

**Continuous engineering** blurs the boundaries between development and operations. Rather than handing off a completed design, engineering teams maintain ongoing involvement through digital twin analysis and model-based sustainment. AI swarms enable the continuous analysis and adaptation that continuous engineering requires.

**Smart manufacturing** integrates AI throughout production processes. Systems engineering swarms can maintain continuity from design through production, ensuring that manufacturing execution aligns with design intent and that production feedback informs design evolution.

### 5.4 Convergent Trajectories

These industry trajectories—INCOSE's vision for transformed SE practice, digital engineering transformations across organizations, and Industry 4.0 concepts—converge toward an engineering future where:
- Digital representations are authoritative and ubiquitous
- Analysis is continuous rather than milestone-bound
- Human expertise focuses on judgment and creativity
- AI capabilities amplify human capacity

The vision of AI-swarm-augmented systems engineering represents not a diversion from current trajectories but their logical extension. Organizations advancing digital engineering maturity, building model-based capabilities, and developing digital twin strategies are preparing—intentionally or not—for AI swarm adoption.
