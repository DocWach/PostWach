## 6. Realizing the Vision: A Call to Action

The vision articulated in this paper will not realize itself. Its achievement requires deliberate action across the systems engineering community—practitioners, researchers, organizations, and standards bodies each contributing to the transformation.

### 6.1 For Systems Engineering Practitioners

Individual systems engineers shape the transformation through their daily choices and career development:

**Develop AI collaboration skills.** Learn to formulate effective directions for AI systems, evaluate AI outputs critically, and integrate AI tools into engineering workflows. These skills will differentiate effective engineers in the transformed practice.

**Experiment with AI tools.** Engage with current AI capabilities, even when imperfect, to build intuition about AI strengths and limitations. Early experience positions practitioners to contribute to and benefit from advancing capabilities.

**Provide feedback.** As AI tools enter engineering practice, practitioner feedback shapes their evolution. Report limitations, suggest improvements, and communicate requirements. Tool developers need engineering expertise to build effective solutions.

**Share experience.** Document and communicate lessons learned from AI adoption—both successes and failures. The community learns faster when experience circulates freely.

### 6.2 For Systems Engineering Researchers

The research community must address fundamental challenges blocking the vision's realization:

**Advance coordination science.** Develop theoretical foundations and practical methods for multi-agent coordination in engineering contexts. How should agent swarms be organized? How should conflicts be resolved? How can coordination overhead be minimized?

**Create evaluation frameworks.** Establish benchmarks and metrics for assessing AI swarm effectiveness in systems engineering. Without rigorous evaluation methods, progress cannot be measured and claims cannot be validated.

**Study human-AI teaming.** Investigate effective patterns for human-AI collaboration in engineering contexts. What oversight models work? How should trust be calibrated? What skills do humans need?

**Develop domain integration methods.** Research approaches for grounding AI systems in domain-specific knowledge and constraints. How can physics, standards, and organizational practices be reliably encoded?

### 6.3 For Systems Engineering Organizations

Organizations must prepare for and enable the transformation:

**Invest in digital infrastructure.** Establish the digital thread, model-based representations, and data management capabilities that AI augmentation requires. These investments pay dividends even before AI adoption and position organizations for AI-enabled acceleration.

**Evolve processes and governance.** Adapt engineering processes for human-AI collaboration. Develop governance frameworks addressing AI involvement in engineering decisions. Start with low-risk applications and extend as experience and trust develop.

**Build organizational AI literacy.** Ensure engineering leadership understands AI capabilities and limitations. Develop workforce strategies addressing skill evolution. Create organizational capacity for responsible AI adoption.

**Pilot and learn.** Conduct controlled pilots of AI augmentation in suitable contexts. Capture lessons learned rigorously. Build organizational experience systematically rather than through ad hoc experimentation.

### 6.4 For Standards Bodies

Professional societies and standards organizations must enable responsible adoption:

**Develop guidance for AI involvement.** Establish frameworks for appropriate AI participation in engineering activities, distinguishing contexts where AI contribution is appropriate from those requiring human execution.

**Address certification implications.** Clarify how AI contributions affect system certification in regulated domains. Define requirements for AI tool qualification and AI-generated artifact verification.

**Enable interoperability.** Develop standards enabling AI systems to interoperate with engineering tools and representations. Common formats, interfaces, and protocols accelerate capability development.

**Facilitate community learning.** Create forums for sharing experience with AI adoption. Collect and disseminate best practices. Enable the community to learn collectively.
