## Abstract

Systems engineering organizations face a growing gap between the complexity of systems they must develop and their capacity to develop them. While digital engineering transformations help, they amplify human capability rather than substitute for it. This paper articulates a vision for systems engineering practice transformed through collaboration with agentic AI swarms—coordinated multi-agent systems that work alongside human engineers as team members rather than mere tools.

We describe an envisioned future where human-AI teams achieve augmented capacity, enhanced quality, accelerated learning, and democratized expertise, while humans retain the judgment, creativity, and accountability that define engineering responsibility. We chart a decade-long transformation path from near-term task augmentation through coordinated multi-agent support to collaborative human-AI teams. We identify enabling technologies and organizational capabilities required, and connect this vision to industry trajectories including INCOSE Vision 2035, digital engineering transformation, and Industry 4.0.

The paper issues calls to action for practitioners, researchers, organizations, and standards bodies. The future of AI-augmented systems engineering will be shaped by the choices our community makes. We advocate proactive engagement to ensure AI advancement serves engineering needs and preserves engineering values.
