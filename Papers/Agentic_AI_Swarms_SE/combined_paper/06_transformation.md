## VI. TRANSFORMATION ROADMAP

The transition from current SE practice to the vision of collaborative human-AI teams requires a phased transformation. This section charts the path, identifying milestones and enabling factors.

### A. Near-Term (2025-2027): Task Augmentation

The transformation begins with AI augmentation of discrete engineering tasks. Engineers employ AI assistants for specific activities while maintaining direct oversight of all outputs.

**Characteristic applications:**
- Documentation assistance: AI generates initial drafts for human refinement
- Requirements analysis: AI identifies potential issues for human resolution
- Design exploration: AI-assisted parametric studies expand alternative evaluation
- Code generation: AI produces code from specifications, subject to human review

**Human role:** In the loop for all decisions. AI tools function as sophisticated assistants. Trust is limited and verified—human oversight catches AI errors.

**Organizational adaptation:** Modest. Existing processes accommodate AI tools. Training focuses on effective tool use. Governance treats AI outputs as engineer-produced artifacts subject to standard review.

**Milestone:** AI-generated artifacts enter production use in non-critical applications.

### B. Mid-Term (2027-2030): Coordinated Multi-Agent Support

As AI capabilities mature and organizational experience accumulates, the transformation progresses to coordinated multi-agent support.

**Characteristic applications:**
- Cross-discipline analysis: Swarms of discipline-specialist agents collaborate on integrated analyses
- Continuous verification: Agent swarms maintain ongoing verification, alerting engineers to issues
- Trade study automation: Multi-objective optimization swarms explore trade spaces comprehensively
- Interface management: Interface agents monitor designs across boundaries, identifying conflicts

**Human role:** Oversight and exception handling. Engineers define objectives and constraints; swarms execute analyses; humans review results and intervene when needed. Trust expands as track records accumulate.

**Organizational adaptation:** More substantial. Processes evolve to accommodate continuous AI analysis alongside milestone reviews. New roles emerge: swarm configuration specialists, AI output auditors. Governance addresses agent authority and output attribution.

**Milestone:** AI swarms participate in certified system development programs.

### C. Long-Term (2030-2035): Collaborative Human-AI Teams

The transformation culminates in collaborative human-AI teams where AI swarms function as team members with defined roles.

**Characteristic applications:**
- AI team members: Agent swarms occupy defined engineering roles, participating in reviews and discussions
- Continuous lifecycle support: Swarms maintain awareness throughout lifecycle
- Institutional memory: AI systems preserve and apply organizational knowledge
- Emergent capability: Human-AI collaboration produces insights neither achieves alone

**Human role:** Judgment, creativity, and accountability. Engineers set direction, make value-laden decisions, engage stakeholders, and bear responsibility. They conduct the orchestra rather than play every instrument.

**Organizational adaptation:** Profound. Organizations restructure around human-AI teams. Career paths and performance metrics reflect the new paradigm. Governance addresses AI participation in engineering decisions with clear accountability.

**Milestone:** Human-AI teams become standard practice in SE organizations.

### D. Enabling Technologies and Organizational Readiness

Transformation pace depends on enabler maturity across multiple dimensions:

**AI capability enablers:**
- *Improved reasoning:* Multi-step reasoning, causal inference, planning
- *Domain grounding:* Reliable access to authoritative domain knowledge
- *Coordination at scale:* Effective coordination among many agents
- *Explainability:* Ability to explain reasoning and trace conclusions

**Infrastructure enablers:**
- *Digital thread:* Continuous, traceable information across lifecycle
- *Model-based representations:* MBSE maturity with formal system models
- *Secure execution environments:* Auditable AI operations
- *Computational resources:* Capacity for concurrent agent operation

**Organizational enablers:**
- *Workforce skills:* Engineers trained for AI collaboration
- *Process adaptation:* Workflows suited to human-AI teaming
- *Governance frameworks:* Clear structures for AI involvement
- *Trust calibration:* Appropriately calibrated reliance on AI

Table II summarizes enabler readiness assessment.

**TABLE II: Enabler Readiness Assessment**

| Enabler Category | Current State | Required State | Gap |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| AI reasoning | Emerging | Robust | Significant |
| Domain grounding | Limited | Comprehensive | Moderate |
| Multi-agent coordination | Early | Production-ready | Significant |
| Digital thread | Partial adoption | Universal | Moderate |
| MBSE maturity | Growing | Widespread | Moderate |
| Workforce skills | Minimal | Ubiquitous | Significant |
| Governance frameworks | Ad hoc | Established | Significant |

Progress is needed across all enablers. The transformation will advance as the slowest-moving enablers allow. Organizations advancing digital engineering maturity and MBSE adoption are positioning themselves for AI swarm integration.
