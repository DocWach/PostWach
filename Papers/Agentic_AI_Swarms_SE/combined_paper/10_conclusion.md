## X. CONCLUSION

This paper has presented a framework for applying agentic AI swarms to systems engineering—a multi-agent architectural approach that addresses the limitations of single-agent AI systems when applied to complex, multi-disciplinary engineering challenges.

### Summary of Contributions

We traced the evolution of AI capabilities through six tiers—from expert systems through machine learning, deep learning, and large language models to agentic AI and agentic swarms—establishing the technological foundation for comprehensive SE support. We presented an architectural framework comprising agent architecture taxonomies, SE-specific specialization patterns, coordination mechanisms, and swarm topologies.

The core contribution systematically mapped swarm capabilities to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 technical process areas, demonstrating applicability across stakeholder needs definition, requirements engineering, architecture definition, design, integration, verification, validation, and lifecycle support. Maturity assessment revealed concentrated development in requirements and verification processes, with substantial opportunities in other lifecycle phases.

We charted a transformation roadmap from near-term task augmentation through mid-term coordinated support to long-term collaborative human-AI teams, identifying enabling technologies and organizational readiness factors. Domain examples in aerospace, defense, healthcare, and energy validated framework generality while acknowledging domain-specific considerations.

We categorized challenges—technical, integration, human factors, and organizational—and proposed a prioritized research agenda with calls to action for practitioners, researchers, organizations, and standards bodies.

### Key Takeaways

For systems engineering practitioners, agentic AI swarms represent augmentation rather than replacement—a means to amplify engineering capability while preserving essential human judgment and accountability. The transformation requires skill evolution but promises substantial capacity enhancement.

For systems engineering researchers, the paper identifies substantial challenges requiring investigation: coordination overhead, domain knowledge integration, emergent behavior management, evaluation metrics, human-swarm interaction, and governance frameworks.

For the broader SE community, the framework provides common vocabulary and structure for advancing AI-augmented practice.

### Call to Action

As AI capabilities advance, the systems engineering community has an opportunity—and responsibility—to shape how these technologies are applied to engineering practice. Reactive response to AI advancement risks outcomes poorly suited to engineering needs. Proactive engagement can ensure that AI swarms serve engineering values: rigor, safety, accountability, and human welfare.

We call for empirical research validating framework claims, standards development establishing governance frameworks, education evolution preparing engineers for collaborative practice, and community building enabling shared learning.

This paper provides one framework for human-AI integration in systems engineering. We invite the community to build upon, critique, and extend this work toward a future where AI amplifies engineering capability in service of humanity's complex challenges.
