## ABSTRACT

Modern engineered systems—spanning aerospace, defense, healthcare, and energy domains—exhibit complexity that strains the capacity of systems engineering organizations. While individual AI assistants help with specific tasks, they face fundamental limitations when applied to systems engineering's inherently collaborative, multi-disciplinary nature. This paper presents a framework for applying agentic AI swarms to systems engineering: coordinated multi-agent systems in which specialized AI agents collaborate to support lifecycle activities.

We trace the evolution of AI capabilities from expert systems through large language models to agentic swarms, establishing the technological foundation for comprehensive systems engineering support. We present an architectural framework comprising agent architecture taxonomies, systems engineering-specific specialization patterns aligned with discipline roles, coordination mechanisms, and swarm topologies with trade-off analysis.

The core contribution systematically maps swarm capabilities to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 technical process areas, demonstrating applicability across stakeholder needs definition, requirements engineering, architecture definition, design, integration, verification, validation, and lifecycle support. We assess maturity across process areas, finding concentrated development in requirements and verification with substantial opportunities elsewhere.

We chart a phased transformation roadmap from near-term task augmentation through mid-term coordinated multi-agent support to long-term collaborative human-AI teams, identifying enabling technologies and organizational readiness factors. Domain examples across aerospace, defense, healthcare, and energy validate framework generality.

We categorize challenges as technical (scalability, reliability, domain knowledge), integration (tools, processes, data), human factors (trust, oversight, skills), and organizational (governance, certification, accountability). A prioritized research agenda addresses each challenge category with calls to action for practitioners, researchers, organizations, and standards bodies.

For systems engineering practitioners and researchers, this paper provides a framework for understanding how AI swarms may augment engineering capability while preserving human judgment and accountability essential to engineering practice.
