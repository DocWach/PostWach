# 3. Catalog Methodology

## Section Purpose
Describe how isomorphisms were identified, characterized, and organized.

## Outline

### 3.1 Scope and Selection Criteria
- Focus: cross-domain isomorphisms between physical/engineered systems
- Inclusion criteria: documented mathematical analogy with variable mappings
- Exclusion: purely metaphorical analogies without mathematical basis

### 3.2 Characterization Schema
- For each isomorphism pair: governing equations, variable mappings, state-space forms
- Classification: exact isomorphism, partial homomorphism, to-investigate
- Tier system: Tier 1 (classical, well-established), Tier 2 (less common), Tier 3 (emerging)

### 3.3 Connection to SE Formalism
- Each entry characterized in terms of: continuous ODE, discrete Moore machine, bond graph, port-Hamiltonian, category theory
- Degradation analysis: how discretization, nonlinearity, stochasticity affect isomorphism
- Connection to T3SD/DEVS morphism conditions and VMMC types
