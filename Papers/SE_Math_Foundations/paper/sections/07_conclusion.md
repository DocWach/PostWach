# 7. Conclusion

## Section Purpose
Summarize contributions and key findings.

## Outline

### Key Findings
1. 13 established cross-domain isomorphisms systematically cataloged with full mathematical characterization
2. Each isomorphism connected to SE formalism (T3SD/DEVS morphism framework, VMMC)
3. Bond graph and port-Hamiltonian representations provide unifying perspective
4. Discretization method determines whether continuous isomorphism is preserved in discrete models
5. Partial isomorphisms (electrical-thermal, chemical-electrical) formally characterized
6. 6 emerging isomorphisms identified for future investigation

### Implications
- Cross-domain analogies are not merely pedagogical tools but formal morphisms in the SE-theoretic sense
- Verification model fidelity can be assessed through isomorphism degradation analysis
- The catalog serves as foundation for a broader mathematical toolkit for SE
