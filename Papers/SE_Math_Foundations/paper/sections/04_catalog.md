# 4. Catalog of Cross-Domain Isomorphisms

## Section Purpose
Present the systematic catalog with full mathematical characterization.

## Outline

### 4.1 Tier 1: Classical Physical-Domain Isomorphisms
- I-1: MSD / Series RLC (force-voltage) -- canonical example, full treatment
- I-2: MSD / Parallel RLC (force-current) -- dual convention
- I-3: Translational / Rotational -- direct structural isomorphism
- I-4: Electrical / Hydraulic -- impedance analogy
- I-5: Electrical / Thermal -- PARTIAL (no inductance analog)
- I-6: Electrical / Acoustic -- impedance analogy
- I-7: Translational / Rotational with coupling -- transformer elements

### 4.2 Tier 2: Less Common Cross-Domain Isomorphisms
- I-8 through I-13: magnetic, compressible fluid, chemical, population, control/signal, queuing

### 4.3 Tier 3: Emerging and Under-Investigated
- I-14 through I-19: biological neural, economic, thermodynamic-information, distributed parameter, software-control, epidemic
- Key open questions for each

### 4.4 Synthesis: Patterns Across the Catalog
- Bond graph unification: all Tier 1 entries share identical bond graph structure under effort/flow mapping
- Where exact isomorphism holds vs. where it degrades
- Common sources of degradation: missing physics (I-5), nonlinearity (I-10, I-11), stochasticity (I-13)
