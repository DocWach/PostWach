# 6. Discussion and Future Work

## Section Purpose
Interpret results, state limitations, and point to future research directions.

## Outline

### 6.1 Significance for SE Practice
- Catalog provides reference for cross-domain verification model selection
- Degradation analysis informs fidelity assessment in digital twins
- Connection to VMMC enables quantitative verification model confidence

### 6.2 Limitations
- Catalog limited to lumped-parameter (ODE) systems; distributed (PDE) systems not covered
- Nonlinear systems only partially addressed (linearized regime)
- Stochastic extensions not fully developed
- Category theory characterization is informal; full rigorous treatment deferred

### 6.3 Future Work
- Idea 6: Formal "degree of homomorphism" metric (layered: structural, behavioral, energy, information, categorical)
- Idea 11: Systematic analysis of T3SD/DEVS sufficiency and limitations
- Idea 16: Full category-theoretic framework (category Sys, functors, natural transformations)
- Idea 17: AI/swarm agents for automated morphism discovery
- Idea 8: Biological/engineered system morphisms (biomimetics)
