# 2. Background

## Section Purpose
Establish the theoretical foundations the paper builds on: T3SD/DEVS, classical analogies, bond graphs, behavioral systems theory.

## Outline

### 2.1 Systems-Theoretic Morphisms (T3SD and DEVS)
- T3SD (Wymorian) formalism: system definition, Moore machine, morphism conditions
- DEVS (Zeigerian) hierarchy: Levels 0-4, I/O system morphism (Eq. 16-20 from DEVS_background.md)
- Wach (2022): 28 morphism proofs, VMMC framework (6 types)
- Key limitation: discrete, deterministic, open systems only

### 2.2 Classical Cross-Domain Analogies
- Historical development: Maxwell (1873), Firestone (1933), Olson (1943)
- Force-voltage vs. force-current conventions
- Generalized variables: effort and flow (Paynter, 1961)
- Current state: well-known in engineering education but not formalized in SE theory

### 2.3 Bond Graphs and Generalized Variables
- Bond graph methodology (Paynter, Karnopp, Breedveld)
- Effort-flow duality across domains
- Generalized energy variables: momentum (p) and displacement (q)
- Power = effort x flow (universal across domains)

### 2.4 Port-Hamiltonian Systems
- van der Schaft framework: Dirac structures, energy-based modeling
- Structure-preserving properties under interconnection
- Connection to bond graphs: port-Hamiltonian as mathematical formalization

### 2.5 Behavioral Systems Theory
- Willems (1972, 2007): behavioral approach to systems
- Behavioral equivalence and bisimulation
- Approximate bisimulation (Girard & Pappas, 2007): quantified behavioral distance
