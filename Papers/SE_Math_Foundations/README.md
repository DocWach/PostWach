# SE Math Foundations

A 25-idea research program establishing the formal mathematical methods that make systems engineering truly domain agnostic.

## Vision

**Informal Objective:** Learn the fundamental, transdisciplinary patterns that establish systems engineering as truly domain agnostic.

**Three Overarching Impacts:**

1. **Education** — Explores whether SE is a fundamental discipline that should be studied as part of all engineering programs.
2. **Practice** — Establishes reuse of engineering knowledge across domains through a scientific (rather than heuristic) approach.
3. **Fundamental science** — Challenges and/or confirms assumptions engineers make about cross-domain relationships.

## Subprojects

| Subproject | Idea(s) | Status | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Isomorphism Library](isomorphism-library/) | 5 | In progress | `isomorphism-library/` |
| Morphism Quality Metric | 6 | Planned | — |
| Bayesian Verification Confidence | 3 | Planned | — |
| Categorical Framework | 7 | Planned | — |
