├── Best for: Methodology-focused papers
└── Structure: Method 1 → Method 2 → Gap

Theoretical:
├── Organize by theoretical perspectives
├── Best for: Theory papers
└── Structure: Theory 1 → Theory 2 → Synthesis

Problem-centered:

"This extends prior findings to [new context]..."

Contradict prior work:
"In contrast to [Author (Year)], we found..."
"This challenges the prevailing view that..."
"One explanation for this discrepancy is..."

"To our knowledge, this is the first..."
"These findings reveal a previously..."
"This suggests a new mechanism by which..."

LIMITATION FRAMING

Acknowledge honestly:
"This study has several limitations."
"[Limitation] may affect generalizability."

But don't apologize excessively:
- State limitation
- Explain impact on conclusions
- Note mitigation efforts
- Suggest how future work can address

Example:
"First, the cross-sectional design precludes
causal inference. However, our theoretical
framework and temporal logic of [X] preceding
[Y] supports the proposed direction. Future
longitudinal research should test this directly."

## Phase 3: Revision and Editing

### Revision Workflow

```
REVISION PROCESS

LEVEL 1: STRUCTURAL REVISION
─────────────────────────────────────────
Questions to ask:
□ Is the argument/logic clear?
□ Does the structure serve the content?
□ Are sections in the right order?
□ Is anything missing?
□ Is anything unnecessary?
□ Do sections flow into each other?

Actions:
- Read outline only—does it make sense?
- Check paragraph topic sentences—do they tell the story?
- Verify each section fulfills its purpose
- Remove or relocate misplaced content
- Add transitions between sections

LEVEL 2: PARAGRAPH REVISION
─────────────────────────────────────────
Questions to ask:
□ Does each paragraph have one main idea?
□ Is the topic sentence clear?
□ Do supporting sentences support?
□ Is evidence integrated effectively?
□ Are transitions smooth?

Actions:
- Check topic sentence starts each paragraph
- Ensure logical flow within paragraphs
- Verify evidence supports claims
- Add or improve transitions
- Split paragraphs that cover too much
- Combine fragments

LEVEL 3: SENTENCE REVISION
─────────────────────────────────────────
Questions to ask:
□ Is every sentence necessary?
□ Are sentences clear and concise?
□ Is sentence structure varied?
□ Is voice appropriate (active/passive)?
□ Are there wordy phrases?

Actions:
- Eliminate redundancy
- Reduce wordiness
- Vary sentence length and structure
- Convert passive to active (where appropriate)
- Fix unclear pronoun references

LEVEL 4: WORD-LEVEL EDITING
─────────────────────────────────────────
Questions to ask:
□ Is word choice precise?
□ Are terms used consistently?
□ Is jargon necessary and defined?
□ Are there clichés or vague terms?

Actions:
- Replace vague words with specific
- Ensure consistent terminology
- Define technical terms on first use
- Remove unnecessary qualifiers

LEVEL 5: PROOFREADING
─────────────────────────────────────────
Check for:
□ Spelling errors
□ Grammar errors
□ Punctuation errors
□ Formatting consistency
□ Reference accuracy
□ Figure/table numbering
□ Cross-reference accuracy

Strategies:
- Read aloud
- Read backwards
- Use text-to-speech
- Print and read on paper
- Fresh eyes after break
```

### Common Writing Problems

```
COMMON ISSUES AND FIXES

CLARITY PROBLEMS
─────────────────────────────────────────
Problem: Long, complex sentences
Fix: Break into multiple sentences
Before: "The study, which was conducted over
three years and involved multiple institutions,
found significant results."
After: "The study spanned three years and involved
multiple institutions. Results were significant."

Problem: Unclear antecedents
Fix: Replace pronoun with noun
Before: "They implemented the system. It improved
performance. This led to adoption."
After: "The team implemented the system. The system
improved performance. This improvement led to adoption."

Problem: Nominalization (verb→noun)
Fix: Use verbs
Before: "The implementation of the system..."
After: "Implementing the system..."
Before: "The investigation of the phenomenon..."
After: "Investigating the phenomenon..."

CONCISENESS PROBLEMS
─────────────────────────────────────────
Wordy phrases → Concise alternatives:
- "in order to" → "to"
- "due to the fact that" → "because"
- "at this point in time" → "now"
- "in the event that" → "if"
- "a large number of" → "many"
- "has the ability to" → "can"
- "it is important to note that" → [delete]
- "it should be pointed out that" → [delete]

Redundancies to remove:
- "basic fundamentals" → "fundamentals"
- "past history" → "history"
- "future plans" → "plans"
- "end result" → "result"
- "completely finish" → "finish"

HEDGING PROBLEMS
─────────────────────────────────────────
Over-hedging (sounds uncertain):
Before: "It might possibly seem to suggest..."
After: "The findings suggest..."

Under-hedging (sounds overconfident):
Before: "This proves that..."
After: "This provides evidence that..."

Appropriate hedging:
- "may/might" for possibility
- "suggests/indicates" for interpretation
- "appears/seems" for uncertain observations
- "is likely" for strong but not certain

FLOW PROBLEMS
─────────────────────────────────────────
Add transitions between ideas:
- Addition: "furthermore," "moreover," "additionally"
- Contrast: "however," "in contrast," "alternatively"
- Cause: "therefore," "consequently," "thus"
- Example: "for instance," "specifically"
- Conclusion: "in summary," "overall"

Use topic strings (old info → new info):
Sentence 1 introduces X.
Sentence 2 starts with X, introduces Y.
Sentence 3 starts with Y, introduces Z.
