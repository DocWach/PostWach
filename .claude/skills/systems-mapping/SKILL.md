# Systems Mapping

A methodology for creating visual and conceptual maps of complex systems, emphasizing relationships, feedback loops, and boundaries. Based on systems thinking, network theory, and process philosophy approaches to understanding interconnected phenomena.

## What This Skill Does

Systems Mapping enables researchers to:
- Visualize complex networks of relationships
- Identify feedback loops and dynamics
- Analyze system boundaries and interfaces
- Understand how parts relate to wholes

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of systems concepts
- Familiarity with network/graph basics
- Some visualization skills helpful

---

## Core Concepts

### What Is Systems Mapping?

```
SYSTEMS MAPPING

A system is more than a collection of parts -
it's the relationships between parts that matter.

Systems mapping makes visible:
- Elements: What are the parts?
- Relationships: How do parts connect?
- Boundaries: What's in/out of the system?
- Dynamics: How does the system behave over time?

The map is not the territory,
but good maps enable navigation.
```

## Element Identification

### Node Discovery Protocol

```
FINDING SYSTEM ELEMENTS

1. BRAINSTORM
   - List everything that might be part of the system
   - Include tangible and intangible elements
   - Don't filter yet

2. CATEGORIZE
   - Group similar elements
   - Identify element types
   - Note hierarchies

3. VERIFY
   - Is this really part of the system?
   - Is it at the right level of detail?
   - Is it necessary for understanding?

4. DEFINE
   - What exactly is this element?
   - What are its properties?
   - What role does it play?
```

### Element Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Stocks** | Accumulations, stores | Inventory, population, knowledge |
| **Flows** | Rates of change | Birth rate, spending, learning |
| **Variables** | Measurable quantities | Temperature, satisfaction, price |
| **Actors** | Agents with agency | People, organizations, algorithms |
| **Processes** | Transformations | Manufacturing, decision-making |
| **Structures** | Patterns, configurations | Hierarchies, networks |

## Relationship Mapping

### Connection Types

```
RELATIONSHIP TAXONOMY

CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS
A ──causes──> B
"A makes B happen"

INFLUENCE RELATIONSHIPS
A ──influences──> B
"A affects B"

FLOW RELATIONSHIPS
A ══flows to══> B
"Something moves from A to B"

DEPENDENCY RELATIONSHIPS
A ←─depends on── B
"A requires B"

CORRELATIVE RELATIONSHIPS
A ←─correlates─> B
"A and B co-vary"

CONTAINMENT RELATIONSHIPS
A ⊃ B
"A contains B"
```

### Relationship Properties

| Property | Question | Notation |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Direction** | One-way or bidirectional? | →, ↔ |
| **Strength** | Strong or weak? | thick/thin lines |
| **Polarity** | Same or opposite effect? | +, - |
| **Delay** | Immediate or delayed? | \|\| (delay marks) |
| **Conditionality** | Always or conditional? | dashed line |

### Relationship Documentation

```

## Feedback Loop Analysis

### Types of Feedback

```
REINFORCING LOOPS (Positive Feedback)
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
A ──(+)──> B ──(+)──┘

"More A leads to more B, which leads to more A"
- Exponential growth or decline
- Virtuous or vicious cycles
- Self-amplifying

BALANCING LOOPS (Negative Feedback)
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │
A ──(+)──> B ──(-)──┘

"More A leads to more B, which leads to less A"
- Goal-seeking behavior
- Stability and equilibrium
- Self-correcting
```

### Loop Identification Protocol

```
FINDING FEEDBACK LOOPS

1. START WITH A VARIABLE
   Pick any element in the system

2. TRACE FORWARD
   Follow causal chains: What does this affect?

3. CHECK FOR RETURN
   Do any chains lead back to the starting point?

4. IDENTIFY LOOP TYPE
   Count negative links:
   - Even number = Reinforcing loop
   - Odd number = Balancing loop

5. DOCUMENT
   - Name the loop
   - Describe its behavior
   - Note its effects
```

### Loop Documentation Template

```
FEEDBACK LOOP: [Name]

Type: [Reinforcing/Balancing]
Elements: [A → B → C → A]
Polarity chain: [(+)(+)(-)]
Net effect: [Growth/Decline/Stability]

Description:
[Narrative explanation of how the loop works]

Significance:
[Why this loop matters]

Evidence:
[How we know this loop exists]
```

## Boundary Analysis

### Defining Boundaries

```
BOUNDARY DECISIONS

INSIDE THE SYSTEM:
- Elements we can affect
- Elements we want to understand
- Elements we need to model

OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM (Environment):
- Elements we can't affect
- Elements we treat as given
- Context and constraints

INTERFACE:
- Where inside meets outside
- Inputs from environment
- Outputs to environment
```

### Boundary Analysis Protocol

```
For each potential element:

1. RELEVANCE TEST
   Does this affect what we're trying to understand?
   - If yes: Consider including
   - If no: Exclude

2. CONTROL TEST
   Can we influence this element?
   - If yes: Likely inside
   - If no: Likely outside (environmental)

3. LEVEL TEST
   Is this at the right level of detail?
   - Too detailed: Aggregate
   - Too abstract: Decompose

4. INTERFACE TEST
   Does this cross the boundary?
   - If yes: It's an interface point
   - Document inputs and outputs
```

### Boundary Diagram

```

│           ENVIRONMENT                    │

## Quality Criteria

Systems mapping is successful when:

1. **Complete**: Key elements and relationships included
2. **Accurate**: Relationships correctly represented
3. **Useful**: Map enables understanding and action
4. **Clear**: Visualization communicates effectively
5. **Bounded**: Appropriate scope and detail
6. **Documented**: Map creation process recorded

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Map is too complex"
→ Increase abstraction level
→ Focus on subset
→ Use multiple maps at different levels

### "Can't find the boundaries"
→ Start with clear purpose
→ Ask what you can/can't control
→ Accept boundaries are decisions

### "Relationships are unclear"
→ Gather more information
→ Use dashed lines for uncertain
→ Note assumptions

### "Can't identify feedback loops"
→ Pick any variable and trace chains
→ Look for recurring patterns
→ Ask: what amplifies or stabilizes?
