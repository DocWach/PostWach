# Evidence Synthesis

A systematic methodology for gathering, evaluating, and integrating evidence from multiple sources. Draws from empiricist philosophy, scientific methodology, and evidence-based practice to build well-grounded knowledge from diverse inputs.

## What This Skill Does

Evidence Synthesis enables researchers to:
- Collect evidence systematically from multiple sources
- Assess source credibility and evidence quality
- Integrate convergent and divergent findings
- Calibrate confidence appropriately to evidence strength

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of research methodology basics
- Familiarity with source evaluation principles
- Comfort with probabilistic reasoning

## Source Credibility Framework

### Credibility Indicators

| Indicator | Description | Assessment Questions |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Expertise** | Domain knowledge | Credentials? Experience? Recognition? |
| **Track Record** | History of reliability | Past accuracy? Corrections made? |
| **Methodology** | Process quality | Transparent? Replicable? Appropriate? |
| **Independence** | Freedom from bias | Funding sources? Conflicts? Incentives? |
| **Corroboration** | External verification | Others agree? Replicated? Consistent? |

### Source Assessment Protocol

```
For each source:

EXPERTISE CHECK
□ Relevant credentials or training?
□ Demonstrated domain knowledge?
□ Recognized by peers in field?
□ Appropriate scope of claims?

METHODOLOGY CHECK
□ Methods clearly described?
□ Methods appropriate for claims?
□ Limitations acknowledged?
□ Data available for review?

INDEPENDENCE CHECK
□ Funding sources disclosed?
□ Conflicts of interest declared?
□ Institutional pressures noted?
□ Motivation transparent?

RELIABILITY CHECK
□ Past claims proven accurate?
□ Errors acknowledged and corrected?
□ Consistent over time?
□ Cautious in uncertainty?

CORROBORATION CHECK
□ Independent verification exists?
□ Other sources agree?
□ Consistent with known facts?
□ Anomalies explained?
```

### Credibility Scoring

```
Score each dimension 0-1:

credibilityScore = {
  expertise: [0-1],
  methodology: [0-1],
  independence: [0-1],
  reliability: [0-1],
  corroboration: [0-1]
}

overallCredibility = weightedAverage(scores)

Interpretation:
0.8-1.0: Highly credible - trust without reservation
0.6-0.8: Credible - trust with normal caution
0.4-0.6: Moderately credible - verify important claims
0.2-0.4: Low credibility - treat with skepticism
0.0-0.2: Not credible - seek alternative sources
```

## Evidence Classification

### Evidence Strength Hierarchy

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **L1: Strong** | Replicated, systematic, independent | Meta-analyses, systematic reviews |
| **L2: Moderate** | Peer-reviewed, some replication | Individual studies, expert consensus |
| **L3: Weak** | Limited validation | Single studies, expert opinion |
| **L4: Anecdotal** | No systematic validation | Case reports, testimonials |
| **L5: Absent** | No evidence found | Speculation, assertion |

### Evidence Relevance Assessment

```
For each piece of evidence E supporting claim C:

DIRECT RELEVANCE
- Does E directly bear on C?
- Is the connection logical?
- Does E address C specifically?

SCOPE MATCH
- Does E cover the domain of C?
- Are contexts comparable?
- Do conditions match?

STRENGTH OF CONNECTION
- How strongly does E support C?
- Are there alternative explanations?
- What is the effect size?

Relevance Score: [High / Moderate / Low / Tangential]
```

### Evidence Quality Grading

```
QUALITY DIMENSIONS

Validity
- Internal: Does it measure what it claims?
- External: Does it generalize?
- Construct: Are concepts operationalized well?

Reliability
- Consistency: Same results on repetition?
- Agreement: Different observers agree?
- Stability: Results stable over time?

Completeness
- Comprehensiveness: All relevant aspects covered?
- Sample: Representative? Adequate size?
- Documentation: Fully reported?

Quality Grade: [A / B / C / D / F]
```

## Evidence Integration

### Handling Convergent Evidence

```
When multiple sources agree:

1. CHECK INDEPENDENCE
   - Are sources truly independent?
   - Do they share common origins?
   - Are they citing each other?

2. ASSESS CONVERGENCE STRENGTH
   - How many sources converge?
   - How diverse are the sources?
   - How different are the methods?

3. AGGREGATE APPROPRIATELY
   - Weight by quality and relevance
   - Note degree of agreement
   - Document the convergence
```

### Handling Divergent Evidence

```
When sources disagree:

1. CHARACTERIZE DISAGREEMENT
   - Factual conflict?
   - Methodological difference?
   - Interpretive variation?
   - Scope difference?

2. DIAGNOSE CAUSE
   - Different data?
   - Different methods?
   - Different assumptions?
   - Different definitions?

3. RESOLVE OR DOCUMENT
   - Can disagreement be resolved?
   - Should one source be preferred?
   - Should uncertainty be noted?
   - Is synthesis possible?
```

### Weight Assignment

```
Evidence Weight = f(Credibility, Strength, Relevance, Quality)

Factors affecting weight:
- Source credibility (higher = more weight)
- Evidence strength level (L1 > L2 > L3 > L4)
- Relevance to claim (direct > indirect)
- Quality grade (A > B > C > D)
- Independence (independent > correlated)
- Recency (recent > dated, usually)

Final weights should be:
- Justified explicitly
- Proportional to evidence value
- Consistent across sources
```

---

## Confidence Calibration

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Description | Evidence Required |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Very High** | Near certainty | Multiple L1 sources, strong convergence |
| **High** | Strong confidence | L1/L2 sources, good convergence |
| **Moderate** | Reasonable confidence | L2/L3 sources, some convergence |
| **Low** | Tentative | L3/L4 sources, limited or mixed |
| **Very Low** | Speculative | L4/L5 sources, significant gaps |

### Calibration Protocol

```
After evidence integration:

1. SUMMARIZE EVIDENCE BASE
   - How many sources?
   - What quality levels?
   - How much convergence?
   - What gaps exist?

2. ASSESS OVERALL STRENGTH
   - Strong enough for confident claim?
   - Moderate support only?
   - Insufficient for conclusion?

3. STATE CONFIDENCE
   - "Based on [evidence summary]..."
   - "We have [level] confidence that..."
   - "This is subject to [limitations]..."

4. DOCUMENT UNCERTAINTY
   - What would increase confidence?
   - What could undermine it?
   - What remains unknown?
```

## Quality Criteria

Evidence synthesis is successful when:

1. **Comprehensiveness**: Relevant sources consulted
2. **Rigor**: Credibility properly assessed
3. **Transparency**: Methods documented
4. **Integration**: Evidence coherently combined
5. **Calibration**: Confidence matches evidence
6. **Acknowledgment**: Gaps and limits noted

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't find enough evidence"
→ Broaden search terms
→ Check adjacent fields
→ Accept gap and note it

### "Sources conflict sharply"
→ Diagnose cause of conflict
→ Check for scope differences
→ May need to report disagreement

### "Credibility assessment is hard"
→ Use checklist systematically
→ Accept uncertainty in assessment
→ Be conservative when unsure

### "Don't know how to weight evidence"
→ Prioritize by strength level
→ Favor independent sources
→ Document weighting rationale
