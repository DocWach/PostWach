will [how it contributes to overall project]."

Example:
"We will characterize the neural mechanisms of
decision-making under uncertainty using fMRI in
healthy adults. We expect to identify specific
prefrontal regions activated during risky choices.
This will establish the neural basis for Aim 2's
intervention study."

```

### Approach/Research Plan

```
APPROACH SECTION FRAMEWORK

STRUCTURE FOR EACH AIM
─────────────────────────────────────────
For Aim X: [Aim statement]

Rationale:
[Why this aim is important and how it fits]

Preliminary data (if applicable):
[Evidence supporting feasibility]

Research design:
[Overall approach and justification]

Methods:
[Detailed procedures]
- Participants/samples
- Measures/instruments
- Procedures
- Analysis plan

Expected outcomes:
[What you expect to find and why]

Potential problems and alternatives:
[What could go wrong and backup plans]

METHODOLOGY PRESENTATION
─────────────────────────────────────────
For each method, address:
1. What: Clearly describe the approach
2. Why: Justify choice over alternatives
3. How: Detail procedures
4. Who: Personnel involved
5. When: Timeline placement

Level of detail:
- Enough for expert to evaluate feasibility
- Not a methods paper—focused on proposal needs
- Reference published protocols when possible
- More detail for novel methods

RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY (NIH)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Address explicitly:
□ Scientific premise (rigor of prior research)
□ Rigorous experimental design
□ Biological variables (sex, age, etc.)
□ Authentication of key resources
□ Statistical plan with power analysis

1. What could go wrong?
2. How likely is this problem?
3. What is your backup plan?
4. How does this affect overall project?

Example:
"If recruitment falls short of target (potential due
to [reason]), we will [alternative]: expand recruitment
sites OR adjust power calculation to detect larger
effects OR shift to intensive longitudinal design.
These alternatives maintain the project's ability to
address Aim 2."

Don't:
✗ List problems without solutions
✗ Suggest fundamental flaws in design
✗ Ignore obvious challenges
```

### Budget Development

```
BUDGET FRAMEWORK

BUDGET CATEGORIES
─────────────────────────────────────────
A. PERSONNEL
   Senior/Key Personnel:
   - PI: [% effort] × [salary] = $
   - Co-I: [% effort] × [salary] = $

   Other Personnel:
   - Postdoc: [% effort] × [salary] = $
   - Graduate students: [% effort] × [stipend] = $
   - Research staff: [% effort] × [salary] = $
   - Undergraduate assistants: $ (hourly)

   Fringe benefits: [rate] × [salaries] = $

B. EQUIPMENT (>$5,000, usually)
   - [Item]: $ (quote attached)

C. TRAVEL
   - Domestic: [# trips] × [cost] = $
   - International: [# trips] × [cost] = $

D. PARTICIPANT COSTS
   - Incentives: [# participants] × [$ each] = $

E. OTHER DIRECT COSTS
   - Materials and supplies: $
   - Publication costs: $
   - Consultant costs: $
   - Subcontracts: $
   - Equipment maintenance: $
   - Service fees: $

F. INDIRECT COSTS (F&A)
   - [rate] × [MTDC base] = $

TOTAL DIRECT COSTS: $
TOTAL INDIRECT COSTS: $
TOTAL PROJECT COSTS: $

BUDGET JUSTIFICATION FORMAT
─────────────────────────────────────────
For each line item, explain:
- What it is
- Why it's needed
- How cost was calculated

Example:
"PERSONNEL

Dr. [PI Name] (Principal Investigator) will devote
20% effort to this project ($XX,XXX salary + $X,XXX
fringe). Dr. [Name] will provide overall scientific
direction, supervise all personnel, conduct analyses
for Aims 1 and 2, and prepare manuscripts.

[Postdoc Name] (Postdoctoral Scholar) will devote
100% effort ($XX,XXX salary + $X,XXX fringe). The
postdoc will be responsible for day-to-day project
management, participant recruitment and data
collection for all aims, and will lead analysis for
Aim 3.

EQUIPMENT
[Equipment item] ($XX,XXX). This [equipment] is
required for [specific purpose in Aim X]. Quote
attached. No suitable equipment is available at
[institution] for this purpose."

COMMON BUDGET MISTAKES
─────────────────────────────────────────
□ Forgetting fringe benefits
□ Using wrong F&A rate
□ Underbudgeting personnel time
□ No escalation for multi-year budgets
□ Missing participant costs
□ Inadequate travel justification
□ Equipment on wrong budget (>$5K threshold)
□ Consultant costs not justified

```
RESUBMISSION DECISION

AFTER UNFUNDED REVIEW
─────────────────────────────────────────

| Just missed (20-25) | Likely resubmit |
| Middle range (25-35) | May resubmit if fixable |
| Low scores (>35) | Unlikely same mechanism |

Questions to ask:
□ Can I address the major concerns?
