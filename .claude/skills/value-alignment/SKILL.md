# Value Alignment

A systematic methodology for ensuring that actions, decisions, and policies align with underlying values and principles. Includes techniques for identifying values, constructing value hierarchies, verifying alignment, and documenting trade-offs.

## What This Skill Does

Value Alignment enables researchers to:
- Identify and articulate core values
- Construct value hierarchies and priorities
- Verify alignment between actions and values
- Document and justify trade-offs when values conflict

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ethics and values
- Comfort with reflective reasoning
- Willingness to make values explicit

---

## Core Concepts

### What Are Values?

```
VALUES DEFINED

Values are:
- Deeply held beliefs about what matters
- Standards for evaluating actions and outcomes
- Guides for priorities and choices
- Conceptions of the good

Values differ from:
- Preferences (may be trivial or unreflective)
- Facts (values are normative, not descriptive)
- Rules (values underlie and justify rules)

Examples:
- Justice, fairness, equality
- Freedom, autonomy, liberty
- Well-being, welfare, flourishing
- Honesty, integrity, truth
- Care, compassion, relationship
```

### Value Alignment

```
ALIGNMENT CONCEPT

Alignment means:
- Actions reflect underlying values
- Decisions are consistent with principles
- Outcomes serve valued ends
- Means are consistent with ends

Misalignment occurs when:
- Actions contradict stated values
- Decisions ignore relevant values
- Outcomes undermine what's valued
- Means corrupt the ends

Alignment is not automatic:
- Values must be made explicit
- Actions must be checked against values
- Trade-offs must be acknowledged
```

## Value Identification

### Value Discovery Protocol

```
IDENTIFYING VALUES

Phase 1: Elicitation
- What do we care about most?
- What principles guide our decisions?
- What would we refuse to compromise?

Phase 2: Articulation
- Name the values explicitly
- Define what each value means
- Specify scope and application

Phase 3: Verification
- Do these really reflect what we value?
- Are there hidden values we haven't named?
- Would we act on these in hard cases?

Phase 4: Documentation
- Record identified values
- Note definitions and scope
- Create value inventory
```

### Value Inventory Template

| Value | Definition | Scope | Priority | Constraints |
|-------|------------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [Value 1] | [What it means] | [Where it applies] | [H/M/L] | [Limits] |
| [Value 2] | [What it means] | [Where it applies] | [H/M/L] | [Limits] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Value Hierarchy Construction

### Building the Hierarchy

```
VALUE HIERARCHY

A value hierarchy orders values by priority:

LEXICAL ORDERING (Strict)
V1 > V2 > V3
V1 must be satisfied before V2 is considered

WEIGHTED ORDERING (Trade-offs)
V1 (weight: 0.4)
V2 (weight: 0.3)
V3 (weight: 0.3)
Values can be traded against each other

THRESHOLD ORDERING (Satisficing)
V1 must reach threshold T1
Then V2 matters
Minimum levels before trade-offs

CONTEXT-DEPENDENT
Priority varies by situation
Different contexts → different orderings
```

### Hierarchy Construction Protocol

```
Phase 1: Paired Comparisons
For each pair of values, ask:
- If forced to choose, which takes priority?
- In what situations?
- Are there constraints?

Phase 2: Overall Ordering
- Build ranking from pairwise comparisons
- Identify inconsistencies
- Resolve through reflection

Phase 3: Weight Assignment (if applicable)
- How much more important is V1 than V2?
- Can values be traded at some ratio?
- Are there thresholds below which no trade?

Phase 4: Context Specification
- Does ordering change by context?
- What factors affect priority?
- Document contextual variations
```

### Hierarchy Documentation

```
VALUE HIERARCHY: [Name/Context]

Lexical Priorities (non-negotiable order):
1. [Value 1] - [Why first]
2. [Value 2] - [Why second]
...

Weighted Values (can trade off):
- [Value A]: Weight X
- [Value B]: Weight Y
- [Value C]: Weight Z

Thresholds:
- [Value 1] minimum: [Level]
- [Value 2] minimum: [Level]

Context Variations:
- In [context 1]: [Ordering]
- In [context 2]: [Ordering]

### Alignment Assessment Matrix

| Value | Action's Effect | Aligned? | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|----------|-------|
| [V1] | [Supports/Undermines/Neutral] | [Y/N/Partial] | [Explanation] |
| [V2] | [Supports/Undermines/Neutral] | [Y/N/Partial] | [Explanation] |
| [V3] | [Supports/Undermines/Neutral] | [Y/N/Partial] | [Explanation] |

### Alignment Scoring

```
ALIGNMENT SCORE

For each value Vi:

+2 = Strongly supports value
+1 = Somewhat supports value
 0 = Neutral / no effect
-1 = Somewhat undermines value
-2 = Strongly undermines value

Weighted Score = Σ(weight_i × score_i)

Overall Alignment:
- Positive: Generally aligned
- Zero: Mixed
- Negative: Misaligned

Note: Single strong violation may override aggregate
```

## Trade-off Documentation

### When Values Conflict

```
TRADE-OFF DOCUMENTATION

When action serves some values but compromises others:

1. IDENTIFY CONFLICT
   - What values are in tension?
   - What does each require?
   - Why can't both be fully satisfied?

2. ANALYZE OPTIONS
   - What alternatives exist?
   - How do alternatives distribute across values?
   - Is there a dominant option?

3. JUSTIFY CHOICE
   - Why is this trade-off acceptable?
   - What value hierarchy supports it?
   - What constraints apply?

4. DOCUMENT SACRIFICE
   - What is being sacrificed?
   - How much is lost?
   - Is this loss reversible?

5. NOTE MORAL REMAINDER
   - Acknowledge what's lost
   - Commit to mitigation if possible
   - Record for future reference
```

## Quality Criteria

Value alignment is successful when:

1. **Explicit**: Values are clearly articulated
2. **Comprehensive**: Relevant values identified
3. **Ordered**: Hierarchy is coherent
4. **Verified**: Alignment systematically checked
5. **Transparent**: Trade-offs documented
6. **Actionable**: Recommendations are clear

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't identify values"
→ Look at past decisions for implicit values
→ Ask what would be refused at any cost
→ Consider stakeholder values

### "Values seem to conflict constantly"
→ Check if conflict is real or apparent
→ Make hierarchy explicit
→ Accept some trade-offs are unavoidable

### "Hierarchy keeps changing"
→ Accept some context-dependence
→ Identify core invariants
→ Document contextual factors

### "Action seems aligned but feels wrong"
→ Check for missing values
→ Consider character/virtue perspective
→ Trust moral intuition as data
