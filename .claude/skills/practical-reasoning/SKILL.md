# Practical Reasoning

A methodology for reasoning about actions and decisions based on pragmatist emphasis on practical consequences. Focuses on means-end relationships, practical syllogisms, and action-oriented synthesis to support decision-making and planning.

## What This Skill Does

Practical Reasoning enables researchers to:
- Analyze means-end relationships systematically
- Construct and evaluate practical syllogisms
- Assess options by their practical consequences
- Synthesize analysis into actionable recommendations

## Prerequisites

- Basic logical reasoning skills
- Familiarity with decision-making concepts
- Understanding of goal-based planning

---

## Core Concepts

### Practical vs. Theoretical Reasoning

```
THEORETICAL REASONING
- Aims at truth
- Conclusion is a belief
- "What is the case?"
- "What should I believe?"

PRACTICAL REASONING
- Aims at action
- Conclusion is a decision/intention
- "What should I do?"
- "What action is warranted?"

KEY DIFFERENCE:
Practical reasoning terminates in action, not just belief.
The output is a decision, plan, or intention.
```

### The Practical Syllogism

```
ARISTOTLE'S PRACTICAL SYLLOGISM

Major Premise: General goal or principle
   "I want to achieve G"
   "A ought to be done"

Minor Premise: Means-end belief
   "Doing M leads to G"
   "In this situation, M achieves G"

Conclusion: Action
   "Therefore, I should do M"
   "Therefore, do M"

EXAMPLE:
Major: I want to stay healthy
Minor: Exercise promotes health
Conclusion: I should exercise
```

## Means-End Analysis

### Identifying Means-End Relations

```
MEANS-END MAPPING

Goal (G)
 │
 ├── Means 1 (M1) ──→ leads to ──→ G
 │    └── Sub-means 1a ──→ leads to ──→ M1
 │    └── Sub-means 1b ──→ leads to ──→ M1
 │
 ├── Means 2 (M2) ──→ leads to ──→ G
 │    └── Sub-means 2a ──→ leads to ──→ M2
 │
 └── Means 3 (M3) ──→ leads to ──→ G

QUESTIONS:
- What actions lead to the goal?
- Are these means necessary or sufficient?
- What sub-means are needed for each means?
- Are there alternative paths?
```

### Evaluating Means-End Relations

| Criterion | Question | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Efficacy** | Does the means achieve the end? | Probability of success |
| **Efficiency** | At what cost? | Resources required |
| **Side Effects** | What else happens? | Positive and negative |
| **Feasibility** | Can we do this? | Practical possibility |
| **Compatibility** | Fits with other goals? | Goal conflicts |

### Means-End Chains

```
HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITION

Ultimate Goal
    │
    ▼
Intermediate Goal 1 ←── means to ultimate goal
    │
    ▼
Intermediate Goal 2 ←── means to intermediate goal 1
    │
    ▼
Immediate Action ←── means to intermediate goal 2

Work backward from ultimate goal to immediate actions.
Each level asks: "What would achieve this?"
```

---

## Consequence Analysis

### Tracing Consequences

```
For each option O:

DIRECT CONSEQUENCES
- What happens immediately if O is chosen?
- What is the first-order effect?

INDIRECT CONSEQUENCES
- What follows from the direct consequences?
- Second, third-order effects?

POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES
- What benefits result?
- What goals are advanced?

NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES
- What costs are incurred?
- What risks materialize?

UNCERTAIN CONSEQUENCES
- What might happen?
- What probabilities apply?
```

### Consequence Comparison Matrix

| Option | Benefits | Costs | Risks | Side Effects | Net Assessment |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| O1 | [List] | [List] | [List] | [List] | [Summary] |
| O2 | [List] | [List] | [List] | [List] | [Summary] |
| O3 | [List] | [List] | [List] | [List] | [Summary] |

## Option Evaluation

### Evaluation Criteria

```
GOAL ACHIEVEMENT
- How well does this option achieve the goal?
- Fully? Partially? Not at all?

EFFICIENCY
- What resources does it require?
- Time, money, effort, other?

FEASIBILITY
- Can this actually be done?
- What obstacles exist?

RISK
- What could go wrong?
- How likely? How bad?

COMPATIBILITY
- Does this conflict with other goals?
- Does it create new problems?

FLEXIBILITY
- Does this preserve future options?
- Or does it foreclose possibilities?
```

### Evaluation Matrix

```
OPTION SCORING

           | Weight | O1  | O2  | O3  |
-----------|--------|-----|-----|-----|
Goal achievement | 0.3  | 8   | 6   | 7   |
Efficiency      | 0.2  | 5   | 8   | 6   |
Feasibility     | 0.2  | 9   | 7   | 5   |
Risk            | 0.2  | 4   | 6   | 7   |
Compatibility   | 0.1  | 7   | 7   | 6   |
-----------|--------|-----|-----|-----|
Weighted Total  |      | 6.6 | 6.6 | 6.2 |
```

## Action-Oriented Synthesis

### From Analysis to Action

```
SYNTHESIS PROTOCOL

1. SUMMARIZE ANALYSIS
   - What do we know?
   - What options exist?
   - How do they compare?

2. IDENTIFY BEST OPTION
   - Which scores highest?
   - Are there decisive considerations?
   - What trade-offs are we making?

3. FORMULATE RECOMMENDATION
   - What specifically should be done?
   - Why this option?
   - With what caveats?

4. SPECIFY IMPLEMENTATION
   - How should this be executed?
   - What steps are required?
   - What resources are needed?

5. IDENTIFY CONTINGENCIES
   - What if things go wrong?
   - What's the fallback?
   - When should we revise?
```

### Decision Documentation

```
DECISION RECORD

Decision: [What was decided]
Date: [When]
Context: [Why decision was needed]

Options Considered:
1. [Option] - [Why considered/rejected]
2. [Option] - [Why considered/rejected]
3. [Option - SELECTED] - [Why selected]

Rationale:
- [Key reason 1]
- [Key reason 2]
- [Key reason 3]

Trade-offs Accepted:
- [What we gave up]

Implementation Plan:
- [Step 1]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]

Review Conditions:
- Revisit if [condition]
```

---

## Common Reasoning Patterns

### If-Then Planning

```
IF [condition], THEN [action]

CONTINGENCY PLANNING:
- If A happens, do X
- If B happens, do Y
- If neither, do Z

EXAMPLE:
- If funding is approved, hire researcher
- If partially approved, begin pilot
- If rejected, seek alternative funding
```

### Satisficing vs. Maximizing

```
MAXIMIZING
- Find the best possible option
- Exhaustive comparison
- Optimize outcome

SATISFICING
- Find a good enough option
- Stop when threshold met
- Accept satisfactory outcome

WHEN TO SATISFICE:
- Decision isn't crucial
- Search costs are high
- Many options are acceptable
- Time is limited
```

## Quality Criteria

Practical reasoning is successful when:

1. **Clear Goal**: Ends are well-defined
2. **Comprehensive Options**: Relevant means identified
3. **Thorough Analysis**: Consequences traced
4. **Fair Evaluation**: Options compared systematically
5. **Justified Decision**: Choice is warranted
6. **Actionable Output**: Implementation is specified

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Goals are unclear"
→ Ask "what would success look like?"
→ Break into sub-goals
→ Prioritize competing goals

### "Too many options"
→ Screen by feasibility first
→ Focus on most promising
→ Consider satisficing

### "Can't predict consequences"
→ Consult experts
→ Look at similar past cases
→ Plan for uncertainty

### "Options seem equal"
→ Revisit evaluation criteria
→ Consider second-order effects
→ Acceptable to choose either
