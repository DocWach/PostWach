### Stakeholder Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Primary** | Directly affected, essential | Employees, customers, users |
| **Secondary** | Indirectly affected | Community, suppliers, competitors |
| **Key** | High power/high interest | Decision-makers, major investors |
| **Marginal** | Low power/low interest | Distant communities |
| **Vulnerable** | Easily harmed, low power | Children, disadvantaged groups |
| **Silent** | Cannot advocate for selves | Future generations, environment |

### Identification Techniques

```
STAKEHOLDER DISCOVERY METHODS

1. BRAINSTORMING
   List everyone who might be affected
   Don't filter at this stage
   Include unlikely stakeholders

2. CHAIN TRACING
   Start with primary stakeholders
   Ask: who do they affect?
   Trace chains of impact

3. CATEGORY PROMPTS
   Go through standard categories
   Check each systematically
   Note who fits where

4. REVERSE PERSPECTIVE
   Imagine being each stakeholder
   What would you care about?
   Who else would you identify?

5. EXPERT CONSULTATION
   Ask domain experts
   Consult affected communities
   Review similar cases
```

## Stakeholder Mapping

         KEY      │    PRIMARY
      PLAYERS     │   STAKEHOLDERS
                  │
Low Power ────────┼──────── High Power
                  │
        KEEP      │    KEEP
       INFORMED   │   SATISFIED
                  │
             Low Interest

Position each stakeholder on grid
Adjust strategy accordingly
```

### Detailed Stakeholder Profile

```
STAKEHOLDER PROFILE TEMPLATE

Name/Group: [Identifier]
Category: [Primary/Secondary/Key/etc.]

INTERESTS
- What do they want from this?
- What are their goals?
- What would satisfy them?

NEEDS
- What do they require?
- What vulnerabilities exist?
- What dependencies?

CONCERNS
- What are they worried about?
- What risks do they see?
- What objections might they have?

POWER
- What influence do they have?
- What resources do they control?
- Can they block or enable?

RELATIONSHIPS
- Who are they connected to?
- What alliances exist?
- What conflicts?

LEGITIMACY
- What is their moral claim?

```

### Interest Analysis Matrix

| Stakeholder | Primary Interests | Concerns | Power | Legitimacy |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|-------|------------|
| [S1] | [What they want] | [Worries] | [H/M/L] | [Basis] |
| [S2] | [What they want] | [Worries] | [H/M/L] | [Basis] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Power and Influence Analysis

### Power Assessment

```
POWER DIMENSIONS

FORMAL AUTHORITY
- Decision rights
- Veto power
- Resource control

RESOURCE CONTROL
- Financial resources
- Information
- Expertise
- Networks

INFLUENCE CAPACITY
- Persuasion ability
- Coalition building
- Public opinion

URGENCY
- Time sensitivity
- Criticality of stake
- Dependency level

LEGITIMACY
- Recognized claims
- Moral authority
- Legal standing
```

### Power-Interest Grid Strategies

```
HIGH POWER, HIGH INTEREST (Key Players)
→ Engage closely
→ Involve in decisions
→ Build strong relationship

HIGH POWER, LOW INTEREST (Keep Satisfied)
→ Keep informed
→ Don't overburden
→ Maintain good relations

LOW POWER, HIGH INTEREST (Keep Informed)
→ Communicate well
→ May become advocates
→ Don't neglect

LOW POWER, LOW INTEREST (Monitor)
→ Minimal effort
→ Monitor for changes
→ Don't ignore completely
```

## Ethical Weighting

### Moral Salience Assessment

```
MORAL SALIENCE FACTORS

Not all stakes are morally equal.
Consider:

1. SEVERITY
   - How serious is the impact?
   - Reversible or irreversible?
   - Magnitude of effect?

2. VULNERABILITY
   - How vulnerable is stakeholder?
   - Can they protect themselves?
   - Power to advocate?

3. PROXIMITY
   - How direct is our relationship?
   - What duties arise?
   - What responsibilities?

4. PROBABILITY
   - How likely is the impact?
   - Certain or speculative?
   - Risk vs. certainty?

5. RIGHTS
   - Are fundamental rights at stake?
   - Negative or positive rights?
   - Legal or moral?
```

### Weighting Protocol

```
STAKEHOLDER WEIGHTING

Option 1: EQUAL WEIGHT
Everyone counts equally
Aggregate across stakeholders
Simple but may ignore differences

Option 2: VULNERABILITY-WEIGHTED
More weight to vulnerable
Priority to worst-off
Rawlsian approach

Option 3: PROPORTIONAL
Weight by stake size
Larger stakes count more
May disadvantage weak

Option 4: RIGHTS-BASED
Absolute priority for rights
Rights trump interests
Deontological constraint

RECOMMENDATION: Hybrid
- Protect rights absolutely
- Among interests, weight by vulnerability
- Consider magnitude
```

## Quality Criteria

Stakeholder analysis is successful when:

1. **Comprehensive**: All significant stakeholders identified
2. **Accurate**: Interests and concerns correctly understood
3. **Nuanced**: Power dynamics mapped
4. **Ethical**: Vulnerable parties prioritized
5. **Actionable**: Clear engagement strategies
6. **Updated**: Revised as situation changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't identify all stakeholders"
→ Use multiple discovery methods
→ Consult domain experts
→ Think about indirect effects

### "Stakeholder interests are unclear"
→ Research or ask directly
→ Consider typical interests
→ Note uncertainty

### "Too many stakeholders"
→ Prioritize by salience
→ Group similar stakeholders
→ Focus on most affected

### "Interests conflict completely"
→ Look for common ground
→ Use ethical frameworks to adjudicate
→ Accept some will be disappointed
