# Inquiry Method

A systematic methodology for conducting inquiry based on C.S. Peirce's pragmatic theory of inquiry. Emphasizes the doubt-belief cycle, the interplay of abduction, deduction, and induction, and the self-correcting nature of scientific investigation.

## What This Skill Does

Inquiry Method enables researchers to:
- Navigate the doubt-belief cycle productively
- Apply abduction, deduction, and induction appropriately
- Conduct self-correcting inquiry
- Understand when and how to fix beliefs

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic logic
- Familiarity with scientific method concepts
- Comfort with uncertainty and revision

## Core Concepts

### The Doubt-Belief Cycle

```
PEIRCE'S INQUIRY CYCLE

     BELIEF (Settled State)
          │
          │ Disruption (surprise, anomaly, conflict)
          ▼
       DOUBT (Unsettled State)
          │
          │ Inquiry (investigation, testing)
          ▼
     BELIEF (New Settled State)
          │
          │ (Cycle continues when new doubts arise)
          ▼
         ...

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Inquiry begins with genuine doubt (not paper doubt)
- Doubt is irritating; we seek to fix belief
- Settled belief enables action
- New evidence/experience can reopen doubt
```

## The Three Modes of Inference

### Abduction (Hypothesis)

```
ABDUCTION: Creative hypothesis generation

Structure:
- The surprising fact C is observed
- But if A were true, C would be a matter of course
- Hence, there is reason to suspect A is true

Function:
- Generates new hypotheses
- Creates possible explanations
- Innovates and suggests

Characteristic:
- Ampliative (goes beyond premises)
- Creative and imaginative
- Fallible but necessary

Example:
- Observation: The streets are wet
- If it rained, the streets would be wet
- Perhaps it rained
```

### Deduction (Prediction)

```
DEDUCTION: Necessary inference from premises

Structure:
- If H is true, then P should be observed
- P is a necessary consequence of H
- Test H by checking P

Function:
- Derives predictions from hypotheses
- Makes consequences explicit
- Identifies what to test

Characteristic:
- Truth-preserving (if premises true, conclusion true)
- Explicative (unpacks what's implicit)
- Certain but not ampliative

Example:
- If it rained, the roof will be wet
- It rained (hypothesized)
- Therefore the roof should be wet
```

### Induction (Testing)

```
INDUCTION: Empirical verification

Structure:
- We predicted P on basis of H
- We observed P (or ~P)
- H is supported (or not) to degree D

Function:
- Tests hypotheses against experience
- Gathers empirical evidence
- Confirms or disconfirms

Characteristic:
- Ampliative (goes beyond premises)
- Fallible (conclusions uncertain)
- Self-correcting over long run

Example:
- We predicted the roof would be wet if it rained
- We checked: the roof is wet
- This supports (but doesn't prove) the rain hypothesis
```

### The Inferential Cycle

```
ABDUCTION → DEDUCTION → INDUCTION → (repeat)

1. Abduction generates hypothesis H
2. Deduction derives predictions P from H
3. Induction tests P empirically
4. Results inform new abduction
5. Cycle continues, refining understanding

This is SELF-CORRECTING:
- Wrong hypotheses eventually fail tests
- Right hypotheses survive testing
- Community of inquiry converges on truth
```

## Methods of Fixing Belief

### Peirce's Four Methods

| Method | Description | Weakness |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Tenacity** | Hold on to what you already believe | Ignores social and empirical challenges |
| **Authority** | Accept what authorities say | Authorities can be wrong, disagree |
| **A Priori** | Accept what seems agreeable to reason | What seems rational varies, no external check |
| **Scientific** | Test beliefs against experience | Slow, requires community, fallible |

### Why Scientific Method is Superior

```
PEIRCE'S ARGUMENT:

The scientific method is distinguished by:

1. EXTERNAL CONSTRAINT
   - Reality provides check on belief
   - Can't just believe what we want
   - Experience corrects error

2. SELF-CORRECTION
   - Wrong beliefs eventually fail
   - Method includes error correction
   - Long-run convergence on truth

3. PUBLIC VERIFIABILITY
   - Anyone can check
   - Community improves inquiry
   - Consensus emerges from shared testing

4. PROGRESSIVE
   - Builds on past findings
   - Accumulates knowledge
   - Gets closer to truth over time
```

## Applying the Inquiry Method

### Step 1: Recognize Genuine Doubt

```
GENUINE DOUBT vs. PAPER DOUBT

Genuine Doubt:
- Real uncertainty that blocks action
- Triggered by experience
- Motivates inquiry

Paper Doubt:
- Pretend skepticism
- No real uncertainty
- Merely philosophical exercise

TEST: Would I act differently if I knew the answer?
If no, doubt may not be genuine.
```

### Step 2: Formulate the Problem

```
PROBLEM FORMULATION CHECKLIST

□ What exactly am I uncertain about?
□ What kind of answer would resolve this?
□ What information would help?
□ What methods could address this?
□ Why does this matter?
```

### Step 3: Generate Hypotheses

```
ABDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS GENERATION

1. What would explain the surprising fact?
2. Generate multiple possibilities
3. Evaluate by:
   - Explanatory power
   - Plausibility
   - Testability
   - Simplicity
4. Select candidates for testing
```

### Step 4: Derive Predictions

```
DEDUCTIVE PREDICTION

For each hypothesis H:
1. If H is true, what should we observe?
2. What would confirm H?
3. What would disconfirm H?
4. What would distinguish H from alternatives?
```

### Step 5: Test Empirically

```
INDUCTIVE TESTING

1. Design test for predictions
2. Conduct test
3. Record observations
4. Compare to predictions
5. Draw warranted conclusions
```

### Step 6: Fix Belief (Tentatively)

```
BELIEF FIXATION

Based on results:
1. What is now warranted?
2. What confidence level is appropriate?
3. What remains uncertain?
4. When should we reopen inquiry?
```

## Quality Criteria

Inquiry method is successful when:

1. **Genuine**: Doubt is real, not artificial
2. **Systematic**: All stages followed appropriately
3. **Creative**: Abduction generates good hypotheses
4. **Rigorous**: Deduction is valid
5. **Empirical**: Induction tests against experience
6. **Tentative**: Conclusions held open to revision

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Stuck in doubt"
→ Formulate specific question
→ Generate any hypotheses
→ Take action to gather evidence

### "Can't generate hypotheses"
→ Study similar cases
→ Consult experts
→ Use analogy and creativity

### "Tests are inconclusive"
→ Design better tests
→ Accept partial progress
→ Identify what would be conclusive

### "Belief won't stick"
→ Check if doubt is genuine
→ Accept uncertainty is normal
→ Act on best available evidence
